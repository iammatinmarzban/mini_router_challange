# mini_router_challange
This was a personal challenge which scratched my curiousity and led me to do this very tiny project.
The project is fully writen in python and has a very simple workflow. 
Since this is a personla project it's not expected to work with your url and endpoints and should be modified.
I've learned about cookies and browser authentications in this project and I set the cookies manually which was fun nevertheless ! 
The code has 3 main functionalities 
1.Shows you the battery percentage of the router(well technically my router)
2.Turn off the router
3.Reboot the router 

To run the app simply run it and enjoy :)
